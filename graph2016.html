			<h3>What is this?</h3>
			<p>The figure above represents a complete graph on 64 vertices. A complete graph is one with an edge connecting every pair of vertices.  I've drawn the graph using small circles on the perimeter of a larger circle to represent the 64 vertices, and a single line connecting each pair of circles to represent the 2016 edges.</p>
			
			<h3>What does this have to do with 2016?</h3>
			<p>The number of edges in the graph above is 2016.  2016 happens to be a triangle number, a number which is of the form <span class="math">n(n-1)/2</span>.  Triangle numbers are neat because they tell us how many pairs we can pick out of n objects when the order of the objects doesn't matter.  We have <span class="math">n</span> choices for the first of the pair, and <span class="math">n-1</span> choices for the second.  The total number of pairs when order matters is then <span class="math">n(n-1)</span>, but we've over-counted by a factor of 2 since the pair with A first and B second is the same as the pair with B first and A second when order doesn't matter.  We divide by 2 to get <span class="math">n(n-1)/2</span>.  In particular <span class="math">2016 = 64(64-1)/2</span>, so there are 2016 pairs one could pick out of a group of 64 objects.  This is precisely the number of edges in the graph.</p>
